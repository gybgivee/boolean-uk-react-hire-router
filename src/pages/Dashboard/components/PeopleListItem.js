 Different between Link and Route
<Route> is an element that renders some components when a current URL matches the route's path.
<Link> is an element used to navigate through routes.

In below example our App component returns <Router> which is the main component for our routing. 
Inside <Router> we create ordered list containing <Link> elements to the specific routes.
